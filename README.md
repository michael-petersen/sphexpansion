### Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud simulation from [Lilleengen et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01688)

This repository provides an interface to a simulation of the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) interaction.

------------------
### Documentation

The main functionalities are explained in the tutorials:
 - Running [orbits](tutorial/orbits_tutorial.ipynb) in the simulation with options for different potential setups and 2 examples of dwarf galaxies;
 - Accessing the simulation [fields](tutorial/fields_tutorial.ipynb) (i.e. densities, potentials, and forces) for different potential setups.

**Due to GitHub file size constraints, we are unable to host the full resolution MW disc potential. We have provided a lower-resolution version in this repository. Therefore, computations in the inner Milky Way have modestly lower fidelity. If your use case is interested in the stellar disc, please email the authors for a full resolution disc basis.** To illustrate the fidelity, an example of a Sun-like orbit in the deforming potential vs a rigid Milky Way is given in the orbit tutorial.

### Installation notes
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sophialilleengen/mwlmc.git

pip install ./mwlmc 
```

You may need to install [`eigen` (v3), a header-only C++ library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html). As a header only library, it is sufficient to download the tarball, unpack, and copy the `Eigen/` directory to `/usr/local/include` (which is already part of the search path for clang). You may also use `brew install eigen` if using a Mac with homebrew. If using macports, the command is `sudo port install eigen3`.

You may also need to install `cmake`. Using homebrew, try `brew install cmake`. If using macports, the corresponding command is `sudo port install cmake`.
